"""Workload spec + constant prediction laws.

A workload is (context tokens L, audio seconds D, SLO). For a measured
workload the planner uses stored constants; for a new one it PREDICTS them
from two laws fitted on the vllm-omni H100 campaign (and flags them as
predictions until the two calibration probes confirm):

  service time   s(L) = a + b*L + c*L^2      (attention-quadratic prefill)
  arrival stall  delta(L) = max(delta_floor, L / prefill_rate)

Both laws are engine-family-shaped; their coefficients are stack-specific.
For sglang-omni run the calibration probes (see plan.py --calibrate) to fit
a/b/c and prefill_rate before trusting cross-workload extrapolation.
