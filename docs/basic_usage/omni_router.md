# SGLang-Omni Rust Router

`sgl-omni-router` is the multi-threaded Rust data plane for SGLang-Omni. It
routes OpenAI-compatible chat, speech, transcription, translation, and
realtime requests across compatible worker replicas with bounded admission,
health-aware selection, and backpressured streaming.

## Overview

- OpenAI-compatible HTTP and WebSocket routes for Omni, TTS, and ASR workers.
- Static worker manifests with explicit model, modality, media, and capacity
  contracts.
- `round_robin` and `least_requests` routing over compatible healthy replicas.
- Direct request streaming for homogeneous worker cohorts and bounded
  classification when routing depends on the request body.
- Pooled upstream HTTP/1.1 connections with request-ID propagation and direct
  response backpressure.
- Status-based health checks, exact admission and worker-capacity accounting,
  Prometheus metrics, diagnostics, and graceful shutdown.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rust and Cargo**

  ```bash
  # Install rustup (Rust installer and version manager)
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

  # Reload shell environment
  source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

  # Verify installation
  rustc --version
  cargo --version
  ```

- **SGLang-Omni**, installed using the
  [installation guide](../get_started/installation.md), for running model
  workers.

The Rust router is built from this repository as a separate binary. It routes
requests to configured SGLang-Omni workers but does not install, launch, or
supervise them.

### Rust Binary

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang-omni.git
cd sglang-omni/sglang_omni_router/rust

# Build release binary
cargo build --release --locked
```

`rust-toolchain.toml` selects the supported Rust toolchain. The optimized
binary is written to `target/release/sgl-omni-router`.

## Checking Version

After installation, verify the installation and check the version:

```bash
./target/release/sgl-omni-router --version
```

## Quick Start

Choose the example that matches the worker service:

| Configuration | Worker service |
| --- | --- |
| `examples/omni.toml` | Multimodal chat with text or audio output |
| `examples/tts.toml` | Speech synthesis, including PCM streaming |
| `examples/asr.toml` | Transcription and speech-to-English translation |

The examples define two workers at `127.0.0.1:8000` and
`127.0.0.1:8001`. Set the worker URLs, model IDs, capacities, and service
profiles to match the processes you are running.

Validate the configuration before starting the router:

```console
./target/release/sgl-omni-router \
  --config examples/omni.toml \
  --check-config
```

Start the router:

```console
./target/release/sgl-omni-router --config examples/omni.toml
```

Wait for readiness and send a request:

```console
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:30000/ready

curl --http1.1 http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1/chat/completions \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-binary \
  '{"model":"omni-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

## Configuration

Configuration is strict UTF-8 TOML. Unknown fields, duplicate fields, missing
required sections, unsupported schema versions, invalid tracing filters, and
invalid limits fail validation. `--check-config` validates the file without
creating a Tokio runtime, binding the listener, initializing tracing, probing
workers, or changing process limits.

The top-level sections are:

| Section | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `server` | Listener address, accepted-connection limit, and request-head timeout |
| `shutdown` | Graceful drain deadline |
| `logging` | Structured log format and tracing filter |
| `router` | Routing policy, classification concurrency, and optional voice owner |
| `admission` | Global and per-service in-flight limits |
| `health` | Probe interval, timeout, thresholds, and concurrency |
| `http_generation` | Chat request limits, trust domain, upstream timeouts, and pool settings |
| `http_media` | Enabled media routes, request limits, trust domain, and upstream settings |
| `websocket` | Speech and realtime routes with setup, connection, and close bounds |
| `workers` | Worker identity, endpoint, health path, exact capacity, and service profiles |

Each worker has a stable ID, base URL, trust domain, optional default model,
health path, exact capacity table, and one or more correlated service profiles.
A profile row describes a combination the worker supports; the router never
combines independent fields from different rows.

DNS worker authorities must declare `resolved_ip`. The router connects to the
pinned address while preserving the configured authority for HTTP `Host` and
TLS SNI. Worker membership remains static for the process lifetime.

Configuration limits are deployment budgets. Set admission, worker capacity,
classification concurrency, connection-pool limits, and timeouts from the
expected workload and worker topology.

Generation requests use HTTP/1.1, JSON content type, no query string, and one
valid `Content-Length`. Ambiguous framing, transfer encoding, trailers,
expectations, content encoding, and oversized uploads are rejected before
dispatch.

A canonical `x-request-id` identifies each request. A valid caller value is
preserved; otherwise the router generates one. The same value is sent to the
worker and returned to the client.

## Routing and Relay

### Request paths

The direct path is available when every eligible replica in a trust-scoped
cohort has the same concrete default model and compatible profile contract.
The router selects a worker without inspecting the body and relays the incoming
body as a backpressured stream.

Requests that require body-owned routing facts reserve aggregate byte capacity,
read the body once, and classify the model, content forms, media placement,
input and output modalities, response format, and stream mode. Classification
runs under one shared concurrency limit. The original bytes are forwarded
without reconstructing JSON or multipart content.

Classification completes before worker-capacity reservation, so classification
does not occupy a worker slot or upstream connection.

### Worker selection

`round_robin` rotates across compatible healthy replicas. `least_requests`
compares exact in-flight occupancy for the required worker-capacity class and
rotates equal ties. Selection reserves worker capacity before dispatch and
performs no network or body work while holding the policy lock.

Routing policy is workload-specific. Use full-corpus measurements at the target
concurrency to choose between the supported policies.

### Admission and backpressure

Global and per-service admission are fail-fast. One request owns its admission
and worker-capacity leases until response EOF, upstream error, or downstream
cancellation.

The router sends one upstream request through a shared HTTP/1.1 connection
pool. Redirects, ambient proxies, retries, and automatic decompression are
disabled. Request and response bodies use direct backpressure without a body
pump, application queue, or extra relay task.

The request deadline covers upload, connection establishment, and upstream
response headers. After headers are committed, a stream ends on upstream EOF
or error, downstream disconnect, or process drain.

## Media and Realtime Sessions

Media routes are enabled independently. Speech batches remain ordered and are
never split; one worker atomically reserves capacity for the complete batch.
Transcription and translation share a capacity class but require separate
profile tasks.

The router preserves validated JSON, text, SSE, encoded audio, raw PCM,
sample-rate and channel metadata, usage, completion-token, and finish-reason
contracts. It does not decode, transcode, or regenerate audio.

Speech and realtime WebSockets terminate both handshakes and pin one worker for
the complete session. Each frame awaits its destination send, preserving frame
type and order without relay tasks or application queues. Setup, connection,
initial speech configuration, and close convergence use explicit bounds.
Application-level idle behavior remains worker-owned.

Managed voices have one explicit owner configured by
`router.voice_owner_worker_id`. Voice CRUD and requests that depend on a stored
voice are pinned to that worker. Stateless speech continues to use normal
worker selection. The router does not store, replicate, or reconcile
worker-local voice data.

## Health and Readiness

Workers start with unknown health. Status-only probes apply the configured
consecutive success and failure thresholds under a shared probe limit.
Transport and upstream protocol failures can request an immediate coalesced
probe. Application responses and capacity exhaustion do not directly change
worker health.

`GET /ready` returns `200` while the process is serving and every enabled
generation, media, and WebSocket service has a compatible healthy worker.
Readiness also requires the configured managed-voice owner to be healthy and
compatible. Current capacity occupancy does not change readiness.

## Operations

`/v1/models` returns a sorted, deduplicated inventory built from worker defaults
and correlated profile model IDs. `/metrics` exposes Prometheus lifecycle,
readiness, health, admission, and worker-capacity gauges. `/diagnostics` returns
bounded deterministic JSON for lifecycle, readiness, admission, and configured
workers.

Operations responses snapshot router-local state and never contact workers.
In-flight values come from the semaphores that enforce capacity; the router
does not maintain duplicate load counters. Metric labels use fixed vocabularies
instead of worker IDs, model IDs, request IDs, paths, or client input.

Structured logging covers lifecycle events, health transitions, and exceptional
conditions. `logging.filter` accepts a tracing filter expression, and
`logging.format` accepts `json` or `compact`.

## Networking and Shutdown

`server.max_connections` bounds accepted client sockets. The listener acquires
capacity before `accept`, and the accepted transport retains the permit through
HTTP upgrade until the socket closes. Accepted sockets enable `TCP_NODELAY`.

`server.header_read_timeout_ms` limits each initial or keep-alive HTTP/1 request
head. It does not limit request bodies, active handlers, responses, streams, or
upgraded transports. Connection-level accept errors retry immediately; other
accept errors are logged and retried after one second.

On Unix, startup raises the `RLIMIT_NOFILE` soft limit toward the
operator-controlled hard limit and verifies room for accepted sockets plus the
listener.

The first `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` closes admission, stops health work, drops the
listener, and drains owned tasks. A distinct second signal or the drain
deadline aborts and joins remaining work and exits with failure.

## Security and Deployment

The router uses one static manifest and one multi-threaded process. It supports
numeric loopback and non-loopback listener addresses, Linux hosts and
containers, and MPS data-parallel worker deployments without a Python
control-plane/data-plane split.

The router does not implement client authentication or terminate TLS. Deploy it
on a trusted network or behind an authenticated TLS proxy.

Dynamic worker discovery and CRUD, request retries, circuit breakers,
cache-aware routing, prefill/decode routing, and worker supervision are outside
this router's data-plane contract.

## Development

### Toolchains

Install the pinned implementation toolchain and minimum-supported Rust version:

```console
rustup toolchain install 1.97.1 \
  --profile minimal \
  --component clippy,rustfmt
rustup toolchain install 1.90.0 --profile minimal
```

`rust-toolchain.toml` selects Rust 1.97.1 for normal commands. Rust 1.90.0 is
used only for compatibility checks.

### Shared build cache

Cargo writes build artifacts to `target/` by default. Developers using multiple
Git worktrees can share one build directory:

```console
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/sglang-omni-router/target"
```

Cargo coordinates concurrent access to the shared directory. Different
toolchains, profiles, targets, and feature sets retain separate fingerprints.
When `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set, Cargo writes the binary to
`$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/sgl-omni-router`.

### Quality gates

Run the same checks used by CI:

```console
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo +1.90.0 check --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- --test-threads=1
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" \
  cargo doc --workspace --all-features --no-deps --locked
cargo build --release --workspace --all-features --locked
```

Validate all tracked deployment examples with the release binary:

```console
binary="${CARGO_TARGET_DIR:-./target}/release/sgl-omni-router"
git ls-files -- 'examples/*.toml' | LC_ALL=C sort | while IFS= read -r config; do
  "$binary" --config "$config" --check-config
done
```

Unit tests live next to the implementation they exercise. Process, HTTP,
media, WebSocket, and voice integration tests live under `tests/` and use real
loopback sockets where transport behavior is part of the contract.
