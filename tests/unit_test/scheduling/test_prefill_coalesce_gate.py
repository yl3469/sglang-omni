"""Behavior tests for the prefill admission-coalescing gate.

The gate holds prefill until ``prefill_coalesce_requests`` are waiting or the
oldest queued request has waited ``prefill_coalesce_wait_ms``. The deadline is
keyed on each request's enqueue time (``_coalesce_enqueue_t``), so partial
upstream admission or an aborted request never restarts the window for the
requests left behind. Chunked prefill in flight and an empty queue pass
straight through. Tested against a stub scheduler with the upstream call
patched to a sentinel.
