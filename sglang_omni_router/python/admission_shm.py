"""Shared-memory admission: one soft global in-flight bound across N DPs.

Layout: one 64-byte slot per DP in a supervisor-owned file, mmap'd by every
process. Each slot is single-writer (its DP); readers (sibling DPs summing
in-flight, the CP aggregating /health, the supervisor) use a per-slot
seqlock: the writer bumps seq to an odd value, writes all fields, then bumps
seq to the next even value; a reader rereads while seq is odd or changed
mid-read. Correctness relies on the seqlock protocol, not on aligned 8-byte
stores being atomic.

Platform restriction (documented, enforced with a warning): the pure-Python
seqlock relies on x86-64 total-store-order semantics plus CPython performing
pack_into as a C-level copy under the GIL; the sequence word is not a native
atomic. Deployment targets are x86-64 Linux only; other architectures are
unsupported for multi-process admission and log a warning at construction.

The slot array carries one extra supervisor-owned RETIRED slot after the DP
slots: on reclaim the dying DP's rejected_total and peak are folded into it,
so those aggregate values survive DP restarts. This is best-effort across
crashes, not exact: a DP killed mid-write leaves its slot unreadable and its
counters are skipped at reclaim (logged), and a shed taken while the DP's own
slot is mid-fold cannot be recorded at all, so the aggregates can lose (never
invent) rejections around a DP crash.

Documented semantics (the bound is a shedding knob, not an invariant):
- the global bound is SOFT: concurrent check-then-increment across processes
  can overshoot by at most N-1 requests;
- inflight is an instantaneous sum of per-slot snapshots, not a linearizable
  value;
- rejected_total is a sum of single-writer counters: exact while DPs are
  live, best-effort across DP crashes (see the retired-slot note above);
- peak_inflight is best-effort: each DP records the highest SUM it observed
  at its own acquire time and the aggregate takes the max; there is no
  global atomic max;
- fencing: acquire/release verify the slot still carries this process's
  (generation, pid); a mismatch means the supervisor reclaimed the slot and
  the process must stop serving (on_fenced is invoked, the operation is a
  no-op);
- slot reclaim is supervisor-only and happens strictly after the owning
  process was reaped (waitpid), so the single-writer discipline holds.
