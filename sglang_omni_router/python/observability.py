"""CP-side aggregation of per-DP worker counters.

DPs report monotonic cumulative totals (never deltas), keyed by
(dp_index, generation, counter_seq): anything not strictly newer is dropped,
so re-delivery and reordering are naturally idempotent.

Baseline protocol (since-CP-start semantics): the first report the CP sees
for a (dp_index, generation) establishes a per-worker BASELINE; a worker's
contribution is its high-water cumulative minus that baseline. A CP restart
therefore restarts the displayed window at zero coherently, regardless of
how long the surviving DPs have been running. The cost is bounded: requests
a DP served before its first post-(re)start flush (at most one flush
interval) are not counted.

Displayed totals never move backwards: cumulative values are clamped to a
per-worker high-water mark (a regressed report, e.g. after a worker URL was
deleted and re-added on the DP, cannot lower the display), workers missing
from a report keep their last contribution, and when a DP generation is
replaced its final contribution is folded into a retired accumulator.

current_active is a gauge, not a counter: the latest reported value, summed
over entries whose last report is recent (a dead DP's in-flight work is gone
with it).
