"""Control-plane app: the single owner of registry, health, and admin state.

In the multi-process router exactly one CP process runs this app. It owns the
mutable worker registry, the HealthChecker, the admin update lock, and the
privileged admin surface; it publishes the routable-worker snapshot after
every state change (health tick, worker CRUD, disable flips around weight
updates) for the stateless data planes to consume; and it hosts the internal
DP channel, including hot-path worker-failure reports and the weight-update
ACK barrier (all live DPs must acknowledge the disabled-worker snapshot
before a weight update is broadcast; on timeout the update fails closed).
